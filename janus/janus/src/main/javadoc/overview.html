  		The janus project corresponds to a global effort to provide a whole methodology and its supporting 
  		set of tools for the analysis, design and implementation of complex applications in terms of holonic 
  		multiagent systems. The goal of our approach is to provide a complete step-by-step guide from 
  		requirements to code. Janus is one these tools.</p>
  	<p>Janus is a multiagent platform that was specifically designed to deal with the implementation 
  		and deployment of holonic and multiagent systems. It is written in Java 1.5 and based on the CRIO
  		organizational metamodel. Its key focus is that it supports the implementation of the concepts of
  		role and organisation as first-class entities.</p>
  	<p>Janus provides a comprehensive set of features to develop, run, display and monitor 
  		multiagent-based applications.</p>
  	<p>The platform also natively manages the concept of recursive agents (holon or agents composed of 
  		agents) to facilitate the deployment of holonic multiagent systems and thus contributes to fill
  		the gap between conception and implementation phases in this domain.</p>
  	<p>Janus is jointly developed by the multiagent teams of the Systems and Transport Laboratory 
  		(SeT-ICAP, Belfort, France) and the Centro de Investigaci&oacute;n de Tecnolog&iacute;as Avanzadas de 
  		Tucum&aacute;n (CITAT, Tucum&aacute;n, Argentina).</p>
